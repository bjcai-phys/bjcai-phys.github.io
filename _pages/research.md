# (A) Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations

Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations (NN-SRC) refer to the phenomenon where two nucleons within a nucleus exhibit strong interactions at short distances, leading to high-momentum components in the nuclear wave function. This has significant implications for understanding nuclear structure and dynamics.

### Key Findings

(1) Approximately 20% of nucleons participate in short-range correlations.

(2) Proton-neutron pairs dominate these correlations.

(3) Studies of NN-SRC provide insights into the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.

### Exciting Topics to be Investigated:
