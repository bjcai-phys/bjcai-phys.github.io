## Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations

Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations (NN-SRC) refer to the phenomenon where two nucleons within a nucleus exhibit strong interactions at short distances, leading to high-momentum components in the nuclear wave function. This has significant implications for understanding nuclear structure and dynamics.

### Key Findings

- Approximately 20% of nucleons participate in short-range correlations.
- Proton-neutron pairs dominate these correlations.
- Studies of NN-SRC provide insights into the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.

## Heavy Ion Collisions

Heavy ion collisions involve accelerating and smashing together heavy nuclei to study the properties of nuclear matter at high temperatures and densities, recreating conditions similar to those just after the Big Bang.

### Research Highlights

- Observation of quark-gluon plasma formation.
- Analysis of particle flow and energy distribution post-collision.
- Validation of theoretical models describing strong interactions.

## Nuclear Structure Studies

Investigations into the arrangement and behavior of protons and neutrons within atomic nuclei, aiming to understand the forces and interactions that govern nuclear stability and reactions.

### Recent Advances

- Development of models describing shell structures in exotic nuclei.
- Exploration of deformation effects on nuclear energy levels.
- Measurement of transition probabilities between nuclear states.
