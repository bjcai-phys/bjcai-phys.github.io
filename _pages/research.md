## Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations

Nucleon-nucleon short range correlations (NN-SRCs) refer to the phenomenon where two nucleons inside a nucleus form tightly correlated pairs due to strong interactions at short distances, leading to high-momentum components in the nuclear wave function. About 20%-25% of nucleons participate in such correlations, with a strong dominance of proton–neutron pairs. NN-SRC generate a characteristic high-momentum tail in the single-nucleon momentum distribution, which significantly deviates from traditional independent-particle models. These correlations play a pivotal role in several areas of nuclear and particle physics, e.g., they affect neutrino–nucleus interactions by altering final-state nucleon emission and impacting neutrino energy reconstruction; they provide crucial input for understanding the equation of state in heavy-ion collisions and the behavior of superdense matter in neutron stars; and they offer fundamental insight into the non-perturbative regime of the strong nuclear force beyond simple mean-field approximations. As such, NN-SRC connect low-energy nuclear structure with high-energy astrophysical phenomena and neutrino physics. Figure taken from <ins>O.Hen et al., RMP, 89, 045002 (2017)</ins>.

## Superdense Matter in Neutron Star Cores

Neutron stars are cosmic laboratories where gravity, quantum mechanics, and nuclear physics converge. These compact stellar remnants—just 10 to 13 kilometers across but up to twice the mass of the Sun—contain matter at densities far beyond that of atomic nuclei. Understanding their internal composition is a fundamental challenge that touches on the limits of the strong nuclear force, the possibility of exotic phases like quark matter, and the true nature of dense matter. A central goal in neutron star physics is to determine the equation of state (EOS)—how pressure depends on energy density—deep inside the star. A key quantity in this context is the speed of sound, which encodes the stiffness of dense matter and directly affects the maximum mass and compactness of neutron stars. Unusual features in the speed of sound profile may indicate phase transitions or new forms of matter under extreme conditions. Recent advances in astrophysical observations have revolutionized our ability to probe neutron star interiors. Gravitational wave events from neutron star mergers, detected by LIGO and Virgo, provide constraints on tidal deformability. Simultaneously, high-precision X-ray timing from NASA’s NICER mission and the upcoming Chinese-European eXTP mission offer mass–radius measurements that are sensitive to the equation of state. These data require equally sophisticated theoretical tools for interpretation. 

The IPAD-TOV method (Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of Dimensionless TOV equations) offers a new model-independent framework for this purpose. By reformulating the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations in a fully dimensionless and intrinsic form, IPAD-TOV captures the essential physics of neutron star structure—revealing universal relations between pressure, energy density, compactness, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Most importantly, it enables the direct extraction of the central EOS from astrophysical observations, without assuming a specific nuclear model. The method can also be extended to explore rotating neutron stars and transport properties occurring in neutron stars, such as thermal and viscous behavior. As multi-messenger data from LIGO, NICER, and eXTP continue to improve, the IPAD-TOV method provides a powerful theoretical bridge between observable phenomena and the microphysics governing the densest known form of matter in the universe.
