## Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations

Nucleon-nucleon short range correlations (NN-SRCs) refer to the phenomenon where two nucleons inside a nucleus form tightly correlated pairs due to strong interactions at short distances, leading to high-momentum components in the nuclear wave function. About 20%-25% of nucleons participate in such correlations, with a strong dominance of proton–neutron pairs. NN-SRC generate a characteristic high-momentum tail in the single-nucleon momentum distribution, which significantly deviates from traditional independent-particle models. These correlations play a pivotal role in several areas of nuclear and particle physics, e.g., they affect neutrino–nucleus interactions by altering final-state nucleon emission and impacting neutrino energy reconstruction; they provide crucial input for understanding the equation of state in heavy-ion collisions and the behavior of superdense matter in neutron stars; and they offer fundamental insight into the non-perturbative regime of the strong nuclear force beyond simple mean-field approximations. As such, NN-SRC connect low-energy nuclear structure with high-energy astrophysical phenomena and neutrino physics.

$$n_{\mathbf{k}} = \int_{-\infty}^0\frac{{\rm d}\omega}{2\pi}\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{k},\omega)=Z_{\mathbf{k}}\Theta(-\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}})+\frac{C}{\mathbf{k}^4}\Theta(\epsilon_{\mathbf{k}})$$
