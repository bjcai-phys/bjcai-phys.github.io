## Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations {.center-title}

Nucleon-Nucleon Short Range Correlations (NN-SRCs) refer to the phenomenon where two nucleons inside a nucleus form tightly correlated pairs due to strong interactions at short distances, leading to high-momentum components in the nuclear wave function. About 20% of nucleons participate in such correlations, with a strong dominance of proton–neutron pairs. NN-SRC generate a characteristic high-momentum tail in the single-nucleon momentum distribution, which significantly deviates from traditional independent-particle models. These correlations play a pivotal role in several areas of nuclear and particle physics: they affect neutrino–nucleus interactions by altering final-state nucleon emission and impacting neutrino energy reconstruction; they provide crucial input for understanding the equation of state in heavy-ion collisions and the behavior of superdense matter in neutron stars; and they offer fundamental insight into the non-perturbative regime of the strong nuclear force beyond simple approximations. As such, NN-SRC connect low-energy nuclear structure with high-energy astrophysical phenomena and neutrino physics.
