Professor Cai’s group investigates the fundamental properties of strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, with a particular emphasis on nuclear matter across diverse physical regimes. Our research spans from the microscopic structure of nuclei, such as short-range correlations and isospin-dependent dynamics in exotic nuclei, to the behavior of superdense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and residing in the cores of neutron stars under intense gravitational and magnetic fields. A central theme of our work is understanding how matter behaves under varying density, temperature, isospin asymmetry, magnetic fields, and spatial dimensions, using these extreme environments as natural laboratories to probe the non-perturbative sector of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).
To achieve this, we develop and apply a range of effective theories and tools rooted in QCD principles, including Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD) and QCD sum rules, the latter providing a powerful semi-analytic bridge between QCD and hadronic observables through the operator product expansion and condensate dynamics. We also explore the universality of quantum many-body behavior, drawing deep conceptual parallels between nuclear systems and ultracold atomic gases, particularly in the context of high-momentum tails and scale-invariant phenomena.
Beyond traditional theory, our group actively integrates high-performance computing, large-scale optimization, and advanced machine learning algorithms to model complex systems, perform data-driven inference, and accelerate discovery. Through this multidisciplinary approach, we aim to connect the microphysics of the strong force with macroscopically observable properties of matter in nuclei, astrophysical objects, and quantum fluids—pushing the boundaries of our understanding of strongly interacting matter from femtometer to astrophysical scales.
