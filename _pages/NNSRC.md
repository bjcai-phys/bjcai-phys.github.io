## Overview

Nucleon-nucleon short-range correlations (NN-SRCs) are quantum mechanical phenomena where the wave functions of two nucleons strongly overlap, leading to high-momentum pairs within the nucleus. These correlations are a manifestation of the nuclear strong force and provide insights into the dense nuclear matter found in systems like neutron stars.

## Key Findings

- **High-Momentum Pairs**: Approximately 20% of nucleons in medium to heavy nuclei are part of short-range correlated pairs.
- **Proton-Neutron Dominance**: Experimental data indicate that these correlated pairs are predominantly proton-neutron pairs, with a smaller fraction of proton-proton pairs.
- **Nuclear Density**: The nuclear density within these correlated pairs is estimated to be about five times larger than the average nuclear matter density.:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}
