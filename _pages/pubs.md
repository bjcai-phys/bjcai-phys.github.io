## Selected Work 1: Central Neutron Star Equation of State from IPAD-TOV

Understanding the extreme physical conditions inside neutron stars is a major challenge in modern nuclear astrophysics. A key difficulty lies in the large theoretical uncertainty of the equation of state of dense matter, which governs how pressure and energy density relate deep within these compact stars. In this work, we introduce IPAD-TOV (Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations), a novel reformulation of the TOV equations that describe hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity. By expressing the TOV equations in a dimensionless form, IPAD-TOV uncovers nearly universal relations among core quantities such as pressure, energy density, and sound speed, relations that remain robust across a wide range of equation of state models. This framework enables a model-independent anatomical study of neutron star interiors, allowing key core properties to be inferred directly from observations. By linking global observables to microphysical insights, IPAD-TOV provides a powerful new tool to constrain the behavior of strongly interacting matter in one of nature’s most extreme environments.

## Selected Work 2: Equation of State of Nuclear Matter in d Dimensions
This work generalizes the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem to arbitrary spatial dimensions and derives analytical expressions for the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter across different dimensional settings. By systematically analyzing the behavior of key nuclear matter properties, such as pressure, incompressibility, and symmetry energy, in reduced or increased spatial dimensions, the study reveals that nuclear systems become more tightly bound and the symmetry energy generally decreases in lower-dimensional spaces. The parabolic approximation remains robust, supported by the suppressed role of higher-order terms across dimensions. An epsilon-expansion framework, based on perturbations around the conventional 3D case, enables tractable connections between the equation of state in 3D and its counterparts in nearby dimensions. A phenomenological model consistent with empirical nuclear and astrophysical constraints is constructed to investigate these effects in detail. The findings indicate that systems in low dimensions often behave like nearly free Fermi gases, especially when short-range correlations are included, while higher-dimensional cases can exhibit unbound behavior. These insights not only offer new perspectives on the dimensional dependence of strongly interacting matter but also have potential implications for modeling exotic nuclear systems, emergent few-body structures, and the behavior of dense matter in astrophysical environments.
