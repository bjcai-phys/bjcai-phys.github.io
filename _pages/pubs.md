## Selected Work 1: Central Neutron Star Equation of State from IPAD-TOV

Understanding the extreme physical conditions inside neutron stars is a major challenge in modern nuclear astrophysics. A key difficulty lies in the large theoretical uncertainty of the equation of state of dense matter, which governs how pressure and energy density relate deep within these compact stars. In this work, we introduce IPAD-TOV (Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations), a novel reformulation of the TOV equations that describe hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity. By expressing the TOV equations in a dimensionless form, IPAD-TOV uncovers nearly universal relations among core quantities such as pressure, energy density, and sound speed, relations that remain robust across a wide range of equation of state models. This framework enables a model-independent anatomical study of neutron star interiors, allowing key core properties to be inferred directly from observations. By linking global observables to microphysical insights, IPAD-TOV provides a powerful new tool to constrain the behavior of strongly interacting matter in one of nature’s most extreme environments.

## Selected Work 2: Equation of State of Nuclear Matter in d Dimensions
This work generalizes the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem to arbitrary spatial dimensions and derives analytical expressions for the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter across different dimensional settings. By systematically analyzing the behavior of key nuclear matter properties, such as pressure, incompressibility, and symmetry energy, in reduced or increased spatial dimensions, the study reveals that nuclear systems become more tightly bound and the symmetry energy generally decreases in lower-dimensional spaces. The parabolic approximation remains robust, supported by the suppressed role of higher-order terms across dimensions. An epsilon-expansion framework, based on perturbations around the conventional 3D case, enables tractable connections between the equation of state in 3D and its counterparts in nearby dimensions. A phenomenological model consistent with empirical nuclear and astrophysical constraints is constructed to investigate these effects in detail. The findings indicate that systems in low dimensions often behave like nearly free Fermi gases, especially when short-range correlations are included, while higher-dimensional cases can exhibit unbound behavior. These insights not only offer new perspectives on the dimensional dependence of strongly interacting matter but also have potential implications for modeling exotic nuclear systems, emergent few-body structures, and the behavior of dense matter in astrophysical environments.

## Selected Work 3: Pure Neutron/Nuclear Matter under QCD Sum Rules

This project investigates the low-density equation of state of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter using QCD sum rules, providing a connection between nuclear matter properties and the underlying quark and gluon dynamics. Based on the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem, the approach enables the derivation of analytical expressions for key quantities such as the energy per particle, pressure, and symmetry energy, grounded in fundamental QCD condensates. By incorporating inputs from nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, the framework constrains the in-medium behavior of quark and gluon condensates and offers insight into hadronic modifications and partial chiral symmetry restoration. Special attention is given to the treatment of four-quark condensates, which are modeled through effective interpolation but play a non-negligible role in theoretical uncertainties. The use of complex-valued Borel transformations helps improve the resolution of spectral functions, extending the applicability of the method. Low-density neutron matter, with its near-universal behavior similar to a unitary Fermi gas, provides a compelling testing ground for these calculations, particularly for extracting imaginary parts of self-energies and transport coefficients through other advanced techniques.

## Selected Work 4: Proton Moves Faster than Neutron in Neutron Skins

This project explores the dual manifestation of neutron skins in coordinate space and proton skins in momentum space in heavy nuclei. Governed by Liouville’s theorem and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, the coexistence and correlation of these spatial and momentum distributions are investigated within an extended Thomas-Fermi approximation that incorporates the effects of nucleon short-range correlations. The analysis reveals a general and robust feature: in nuclei with neutron-rich surfaces, protons tend to exhibit higher average momenta than neutrons. This finding provides a novel perspective on the internal dynamics of asymmetric nuclear systems and deepens our understanding of the interplay between spatial and momentum distributions in finite nuclei.

## Selected Work 5: Self-energy Decomposition of Nuclear Symmetry Energy 

This project utilizes the Hugenholtz–Van Hove theorem to derive analytical expressions for the nuclear symmetry energy and its density slope in terms of Lorentz covariant nucleon self-energies in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter. These model-independent formulations provide key insights into the density dependence and microscopic origin of the symmetry energy within a fully relativistic framework. As an illustrative case, the decomposition of self-energies is analyzed in the nonlinear scalar-vector-isovector-scalar (commonly denoted as sigma–omega–rho–delta) relativistic mean-field model, where closed-form expressions are obtained. The results clarify how specific meson-nucleon couplings and Lorentz structures shape the behavior of the symmetry energy, contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding of isospin effects in dense nuclear matter.
