## Selected Work 1: Central Neutron Star Equation of State from IPAD-TOV

Understanding the extreme physical conditions inside neutron stars is a major challenge in modern nuclear astrophysics. A key difficulty lies in the large theoretical uncertainty of the equation of state of dense matter, which governs how pressure and energy density relate deep within these compact stars. In this work, we introduce IPAD-TOV (Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations), a novel reformulation of the TOV equations that describe hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativity. By expressing the TOV equations in a dimensionless form, IPAD-TOV uncovers nearly universal relations among core quantities such as pressure, energy density, and sound speed, relations that remain robust across a wide range of equation of state models. This framework enables a model-independent anatomical study of neutron star interiors, allowing key core properties to be inferred directly from observations. By linking global observables to microphysical insights, IPAD-TOV provides a powerful new tool to constrain the behavior of strongly interacting matter in one of natureâ€™s most extreme environments.
